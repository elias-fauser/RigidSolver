Roadmap:
* Rendering of ground plane and one Model
* Creation of particles. They can be rendered
* Implementing Solver so that gravity affects models/particles. Models fall. Spawning with set spawn time
* Collision are detected
* Ground plane collision

Implementation:
* Destructor
* APIVAR Limits
* Error when reloading shaders
* Initialize Position Textures with emitter position
* The Grid must be updated when the ParticleSize is changed
* How to handle spawning if time is too low and objects intersect (Forces will be great)
* Textures should probably be with full coordinates instead of [0,1]
* Normalize the outputs to textures
* Scaling for depth peeling must be reverted on the particles
* particlePositionsTexture needs to be relative to CoM
* Check the layout position qualifiers for out
* Can I remove the second pair of momentum attachments?
