Roadmap:
* Rendering of ground plane and one Model
* Creation of particles. They can be rendered
* Implementing Solver so that gravity affects models/particles. Models fall. Spawning with set spawn time
* Collision are detected
* Ground plane collision

Implementation:
* Destructor
* APIVAR Limits
* Error when reloading shaders
* The Grid must be updated when the ParticleSize is changed
* How to handle spawning if time is too low and objects intersect (Forces will be great)
* Normalize the outputs to textures
* Scaling for depth peeling must be reverted on the particles
* Check the layout position qualifiers for out
* Inertia Tenesor needs to be recalculated
