Roadmap:
* Rendering of ground plane and one Model
* Implementing Solver so that gravity affects models/particles. Models fall. Spawning with set spawn time
* Collision are detected
* Ground plane collision

Implementation:
* Destructor
* APIVAR Limits
* Error when reloading shaders
* Initialize Position Textures with emitter position
* How to handle spawning if time is too low and objects intersect (Forces will be great)
